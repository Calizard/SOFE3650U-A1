SOFE 3650U - Assignment 1: Design Patterns

**Structure of Repository**  
-src  
  &nbsp; contains all the Java source files required  
-TestFiles  
  &nbsp; contains the files needed to test the code  
    &nbsp;&nbsp; price_list.dat is a data file that contains comma-separated values (product name and product price)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is used to set the price after a product has been created  
    &nbsp;&nbsp; GroceryTest.java is a Java main class to test the code  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is also found in the src directory as it should be located along with the other source files to compile  
-UML_Diagram.pdf  
  &nbsp; answer file to exercise 1 of this assignment  

**Test Method Details**  
To test our program we:  
  &nbsp; 1. Stored the product name and price respectively in a Map object  
  &nbsp; 2. Created our concrete factories  
  &nbsp; 3. Created grocery products  
  &nbsp; 4. Set the product prices of each grocery product by utilizing the map object to fetch the product price  
  &nbsp; 5. Display the attributes of each grocery product and verify that they are correct  
In our test, we demonstrated our code by creating the following grocery products:  
  &nbsp; Apple, Banana, Orange  
Execution of our Test:
